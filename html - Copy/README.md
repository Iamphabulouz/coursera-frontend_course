HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard language used for creating web pages. HTML uses a set of markup tags to define the structure and content of a web page. One of the most important tags in HTML is the <form> tag, which is used to create a form on a web page.

A form is a section of a web page that allows users to input information and submit it to a server for processing. Forms are commonly used for a variety of purposes, such as:

Contact forms
Login forms
Registration forms
Surveys
Feedback forms
Search forms
The <form> tag has several attributes that are used to define the characteristics of the form, such as the method of data submission, the URL of the server script that will process the data, and the type of encoding used for the data.

Here is an example of a simple HTML form:

<form method="post" action="/submit-form">
  <label for="name">Name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="name" name="name" required>

  <label for="email">Email:</label>
  <input type="email" id="email" name="email" required>

  <label for="message">Message:</label>
  <textarea id="message" name="message" required></textarea>

  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
In this example, the form has three fields: Name, Email, and Message. Each field has a label to identify it and an input element to allow the user to input data. The required attribute on each input element specifies that the field is mandatory and must be filled in before the form can be submitted. The method attribute on the <form> tag specifies the HTTP method to be used for submitting the form data, and the action attribute specifies the URL of the server script that will process the form data.

When the user clicks the "Submit" button, the data entered into the form is sent to the server specified in the action attribute. The server script can then process the data and respond accordingly.
